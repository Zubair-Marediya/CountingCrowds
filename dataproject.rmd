# Introduction
                   
The purpose of this project is to gauge the number of people participating in an anti-war demonstration in San Francisco. There has been much debate over the US involvement in Iraq so the San Francisco Chronicle tried to use aerial photography to estimate the size of a particular protest. Counting every single person one by one in these photographs would be a very cumbersome task that would likely lead to a significant amount of human error. Furthermore, there seemed to be a pattern across all the images. When analyzed in pieces, the grids appeared to follow a consistent classification of crowd density. Thus, it made sense to apply a sampling method that took these classifications into account and to only count select amounts of grids within these different classification groups. Therefore, stratified sampling was the sampling method that was selected. This allows us to put more time into accurately counting the sections we actually measure. Using the sampling method described below, we obtained a crowd count of 61,732 with a 95% confidence interval of [57121, 66343] people. We will describe the details of our study below.

# Methodology

Our first step was to open the six PDF images in Adobe Photoshop. We needed to divide all of the images into reasonably sized grids from which we could sample. These grids serve as our sampling and observation units. After experimenting with different settings, we decided to split each of the six large photographs into 600 by 600 pixel grids. We looked through the grids and divided the ones most densely packed with people in half again (600 by 300 pixels) to make counting easier.

The next step in this process was to pick the strata. We looked carefully at the grids to decide how to split them up most logically. It seemed to us that the grids we drew were either quite full or quite empty. We decided that we would stratify by the density of the crowds in the grids. Our five strata were for grids 0-5%, 6-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, and 76-100% full. At this point, we went through each grid and color coded it depending on which stratum we believed it belonged to (see images below). After this, we counted the number of grids in each stratum.

We wanted the proportion of grids from each stratum in our sample to be about equal to the proportion of grids of that stratum in the population (proportional allocation). For example, if 50 of 200 grids in our population were from stratum one, then 5 of 20 grids in our sample would be from stratum one. Once we decided how many grids we wanted to sample from each stratum, we used a random number generator in R to select the actual grids. Grids were numbered moving first from top to bottom and then from left to right.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed('786')
red_samps = sample(1:35, size = 7)
yellow_samps = sample(1:43, size = 9)
blue_samps = sample(1:40, size = 8)
green_samps = sample(1:52, size = 10)
pink_samps = sample(1:65, size = 13)
```

After that, we meticulously counted the number of people in the selected grids. We used the paintbrush tool in Photoshop to mark off people in the images and counted as we went. Once we got an estimate for each grid,we averaged within the stratum (see calculations in the Results section). We multiplied the stratum average by the total number of grids in that stratum and added these five numbers together to get our estimate. The standard error calculation is also shown below.

# Results

We begin by importing our data from our CSV file and seperating out the strata grid counts by color.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data = read.csv("dataproject.csv")
red = data$Grid.Count[data$Grid.Color == "76-100%"]
yellow = data$Grid.Count[data$Grid.Color == "51-75%"]
blue = data$Grid.Count[data$Grid.Color == "26-50%"]
green = data$Grid.Count[data$Grid.Color == "6-25%"]
purple = data$Grid.Count[data$Grid.Color == "0-5%"]
```

Here is a comparison of the boxplots of grid counts by their stratum.

        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "black")) +

  ylab("Grid Count")
```

Our main goal of this project is to calculate a 95% Confidence Interval of the total across the strata. In order to do this, we must first calculate the estimate of the total across the strata. 

The following is the formula to find the estimated total:

$$
  \hat{t}_{strata} = \sum\limits_{h=1}^H \hat{t}_{h}
$$

Recall that:

$$
  \hat{t}_{h} = N_{h}\times \bar{y}_{h}
$$

where $N_{h}$ is population size of the stratum and $\bar{y}_{h}$ is the mean of the stratum.

Let's substitute this in the equation for $\hat{t}_{strata}$.

$$
  \hat{t}_{strata} = \sum\limits_{h=1}^H N_{h}\bar{y}_{h}
$$
  
Now we will compute $\hat{t}_{strata}$ in R.

```{r}
stratum.list = list(red, yellow, blue, green, purple)
stratum.population = c(70, 43, 40, 52, 65)
stratum.mean = sapply(stratum.list, mean)
strata.total = sum(stratum.population * stratum.mean)
```

```{r}
strata.total
```

To find the confidence interval of the total among all the strata, we also need to find the standard error of the total. To do this, we must first calculate the variance of the total across the strata. Because the total in each stratum is independent from all others, we can use independence to add up the variance of the total in each stratum to find the variance of the total among all strata.

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  Var(\hat{t}_{strata}) & = Var(\hat{t}_{h=1}) + Var(\hat{t}_{h=2}) + \cdot\cdot\cdot + Var(\hat{t}_{h=H}) \\ 
  & = \sum\limits_{h=1}^H Var(\hat{t}_{h})
  \end{aligned}
$$

We will now substitute for $\hat{t}_{h}$ in the equation for $Var(\hat{t}_{strata})$.

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  Var(\hat{t}_{strata}) & = \sum\limits_{h=1}^H Var(N_{h}\bar{y}_{h}) \\
  & = \sum\limits_{h=1}^H N_{h}^2Var(\bar{y}_{h})
  \end{aligned}
$$

Now recall the following approximation:

$$
  Var(\bar{y}_{h}) \approx (1 - \frac{n_{h}}{N_{h}})\frac{s^2_{h}}{n_{h}}
$$

where $n_{h}$ is the size of the sample in stratum $h$, $s^2_{h}$ is the variance of the sample in stratum $h$, and the first term in the product, $(1 - \frac{n_{h}}{N_{h}})$, is the finite population correction factor. 

Because we do not know $S^2_{h}$, the variance of the population in stratum $h$, we must approximate the variance with $s^2_{h}$. Thus, we will plug in the approximation above into the equation for $Var(\hat{t}_{strata})$.

$$ 
  Var(\hat{t}_{strata}) \approx \sum\limits_{h=1}^H N_{h}^2(1 - \frac{n_{h}}{N_{h}})\frac{s^2_{h}}{n_{h}}
$$


Now we can solve for $SE(\hat{t}_{strata})$, the standard error of the total across the strata.

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  SE(\hat{t}_{strata}) & = \sqrt{Var(\hat{t}_{strata})} \\
  & \approx \sqrt{\sum\limits_{h=1}^H N_{h}^2(1 - \frac{n_{h}}{N_{h}})\frac{s^2_{h}}{n_{h}}}
  \end{aligned}
$$

Now we will compute $SE(\hat{t}_{strata})$ in R.

```{r}
stratum.samplesize = c(14, 9, 8, 10, 13)
stratum.variance = sapply(stratum.list, var)
FPC = 1 - stratum.samplesize/stratum.population
strata.totalSE = sqrt(sum(stratum.population^2 * 
                          FPC * 
                          (stratum.variance/stratum.samplesize)))
```

```{r}
strata.totalSE
```

To compute the 95% Confidence Interval, we need to solve for the following:

$$
  95\%\:\text{Confidence Interval} = [\hat{t}_{strata} - 1.96 \times SE(\hat{t}_{strata}),\:\hat{t}_{strata} + 1.96 \times SE(\hat{t}_{strata})]
$$

Plugging in our values for $\hat{t}_{strata}$ and $SE(\hat{t}_{strata})$ gives us:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  95\%\:\text{Confidence Interval} & = [61732.2 - 1.96 \times 2352.209,\: 61732.2 + 1.96 \times 2352.209] \\
  & = [57121,\: 66343]
  \end{aligned}
$$

# Discussion

Our estimate of 61,732 people seems reasonably close to The Chronicle's estimate of 65,000. The Chronicle's estimate is also contained in our 95% confidence interval. We put a lot of time and effort into designing the strata, sampling, and taking measurements. However, like all studies, ours is not perfect and has some potential limitations.

We defined our strata based on what seemed most fitting after studying the distribution of the crowd densities among the grids. Because these were qualitative preliminary judgements, they are subject to error. We tried to assign grids to the strata as carefully as possible, but this is somewhat subjective. Some of the grids were harder than others to classify, which introduces room for more error. For the most dense stratum, we realized that it was too overwhelming and difficult to count the number of people in an entire 600 by 600 grid. We divided each of the 600 by 600 grids in this stratum in half. Our estimates for the number of people in a 600 by 600 grid in this stratum were our measurements times two. This implicitly implies an assumption of complete uniformity within the grid.

One of our largest sources of error comes from when we had to count the number of people in the sampled grids. These are aerial photographs, so people just appear as black dots.  The darkness of the pictures in some areas made it very difficult to tell what was a person as opposed to a tree, telephone poll, parking meter, etc. It was especially difficult to count people who were standing in close groups because they blended together in the image. Sometimes, we found it easier to count the number of shadows instead of dots.

Though all of these factors are sources of potential inaccuracy in our study, some of them are practically unavoidable. Thus, when we dealt with factors with which we could minimize error, we tried to be as precise as possible.

# Summary

Our goal was to get an estimate for the number of people at a peace march in San Francisco and we ended up with a 95% confidence interval of [57121, 66343]. While our estimate has some variance, it gives us a good idea of the order of magnitude of the desired quantity. Our confidence interval is consistent with the estimate found by the San Francisco Chronicle. Sampling allowed us to answer our research question quickly and efficiently. Using stratified sampling with proportional allocation let us sample with more precision as we had a smaller variance of the total across the strata.
